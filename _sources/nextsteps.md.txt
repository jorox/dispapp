# Conclusion

## Some thoughts

- The project gave us deeper insight into the effect of pressure on the normal modes of argon. However, 

- We can use this code for any solid we want (crystalline, amorphous, bulk, or nanostructure).

- It would be interesting to continue development and use it to calculate the dynamical matrix from the raw trajectory data. This would allow for much more possibilities. The use of multiprocessing becomes necessary there.

- Bokeh is an excellent library for visualizing data especially for MD. We need to continue developing interactive graphs.

## To do

1. Average the values of the dynamical matrix in post to see if the data is improved (smoothed)

2. Calculate the DOS from the dispersion curve.

3. Plot the stress-strain curve and link it to the the interactive plot.

4. Use the data to calculate the thermal properties of argon.

5. Try for another material.

6. Finish the documentation in restructuredText and include it here.
